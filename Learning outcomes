After completing the course the student is expected to be able to:

Knowledge:
- Identify and distinguish between stationary and nonstationary VAR models.
- Estimate, interpretate and identificate the structural VAR models.
- Distinguish and assess alternative approaches to identify structural VARs.
- Inference in structural VARs.
- Evaluate and compare empirical results from other approaches (DSGE models) with structural VARs.
- Formulate economic hypotheses used as restrictions when identifying structural VARs including cointegration restrictions. 

Skills:
- Specify and estimate structural VAR models.
- Estimate structural VAR models applying different types of identification and assess whether the model is exact-, under- or overidentified. 
- Apply structural VARs to the analysis of macroeconomic
- Analyze the VAR model for variables integrated of order two and perform a nominal-to-real transformation.
- Analyze economic data using structural VAR models and assess the empirical results.
- Use MATLAB to analyze new data sets using pre-programmed modules and program new procedures.   
- Identify the model given the data generating process and to program the chosen method in MATLAB.

Competencies:
- Independently formulate and analyze structural VARs for new economic problems.
- Formulate hypotheses used to identify structural VARs derived from economic theory.
- Apply economic theory to obtain an understanding of the mechanisms governing the dynamics of a certain data set.
- Use and design new programs in MATLAB.
